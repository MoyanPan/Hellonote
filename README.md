## Future Plan
Our project UI can be enhanced with features like toggle theme, planner calendar, exporting to PDF functionality, and a more responsive UI design. Looking into the bigger picture, with the use of react framework, we can build on top of our current web app, to go mobile, go live and collect user feedback. Furthermore a community can be created as an interactive forum, where users can share their ideas and help each other.
